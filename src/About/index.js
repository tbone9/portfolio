                <h2>About Tyler</h2>
                <p>I am a web developer that gets excited about diving into the logic of applications to create useful and efficient experiences.</p>
                <p>In another life, I was a professional ski racer and member of the US Paralympic Alpine Ski Team. For 15 years I traveled the ski world, representing my country at the highest levels of competition. I learned how to maintain peak performance and accomplish complex, long-term goals through mental and physical training, as well as extensive technological research. After four Paralympics with two silver medals in the 2018 PyeongChang games, one overall world cup title, and three gold medals in the Winter X-Games, I had enough. </p>
                <p>After retiring from competition I wanted to focus on developing a set of valuable skills, and found web development to be the perfect combination of technology and creativity. I love to create applications that solve problems and are intuitive to use.</p>
